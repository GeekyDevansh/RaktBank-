# रक्तBANK
रक्तBANK is an online portal for bridging the gap between blood donors & patients.

## PROBLEM: 
# Every day 12,000 people in India die due to the sheer lack of donated blood. India collects 11 million units of blood but needs 15 million units, so there's a deficit of 4 million units. Over 40 districts in India don't have a single blood bank!
# ~ The New Indian Express

## SOLUTION:  

Here on this portal, the blood donors can directly see the details of patients in need and can help them. We aim to make this portal as mainstream as a blood bank.Through this portal the donors would feel content about the fact that their donation helped someone in front of their eyes.

### So, with the motto – “Be the reason someone’s heart beats strong”, here is रक्तBank for you all

## DESCRIPTION OF IDEA
On opening the website link, you will see a google oAuth page where you can login through your google account to continue to the website.
 
On signing in you would reach the homepage with a user friendly & attractive UI. There you would be able to choose either from Need Help or Donate. On scrolling down, you will find the eligibility and benefits of blood donation. 

On clicking need help, you may find a form to fill the details (patient name , hospital address , blood group , contact number) . The website is dynamic and collects user data in real time, stores it in the firestore and fetches the data in the donate section.

Again, going back to home page & clicking donate button you will find different patient cards where you can see registered info and can contact one of them (the one who is near your location and has the same blood group as yours) to proceed further.
 
Some more pages like About & Contact us is added. Contact us will direct you to a google form where you can write your details and message.
 
## DYSLEXIC FRIENDLY MODE

1/3rd of the people on Earth are dyslexic.Even Albert Einstein was dyslexic. However not many websites are dyslexic friendly. We have a dyslexic mode which when enabled (by clicking on the radio button in the navbar) changes the state of all the components and make it comfortable for people with dyslexia to operate our website.
